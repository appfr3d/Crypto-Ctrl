# Crypto-Ctrl
This is an iOS App that show data on the top cryptocurrencies, from the coinmarketcap api

Inside the app you can swipe left on the currencies you care about to add the to the Today widget.
This way you can allways be up to date with the cryptocurrencies you want.

### Why I made this
I made this because I wanted a Today widget that supported this feature, and thought it would be cool to 
learn how a Today widget worked.
